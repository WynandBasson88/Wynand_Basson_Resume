				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
					My name is Wynand Basson. I am a very driven individual who originally studied electrical & electronics engineering only to find that it was not a good fit 
					for me after all. My experience as an electrical engineer gave me unique skills such as a practical approach to fault finding and problem solving. My more 
					recent experiences of working onboard a cruise ship and traveling the world however made me realize that I needed to make a career change to an environment 
					that allows me to be more creative and enables me to convert new ideas into functional products. This adventure onboard reignited my passion for technology 
					by taking me to some of the most technologically advanced cities in the world. Being in contact with so many different people and cultures was an invaluable 
					experience and instrumental in my personal development and self-discovery. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Software development for me started as a hobby but quickly became an aspiration when I realised the creative freedom it provides. I started down this path 
					when I developed my own video game using C++ and Unreal Engine. This process quickly led me to pursue a rewarding and fulfilling career as a software 
					developer. I therefore decided to enrol at Hyperion Development and formally study Software Engineering. In my spare time I create passion projects to 
					continuously improve my coding skills. Links to these projects can be found on this page.
				</p>
				<p>
					My passion for software and technology is not my only defining characteristic. I am also very passionate about singing, traveling, watching movies, playing 
					video games and spending time with my family and my dogs. I live my life by the following words: "You don't need anyones permission to be exactly who you 
					want to be" - Hayley Williams
